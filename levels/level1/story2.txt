Asami:Korra! Wake up! We're in the Spirit World and the first thing you do is nap?
Korra:I'm awake! Sorry, traveling makes me tired.
Bolin:Hey guys! Mako and I decided to come along too. Can't let just you two have all the fun now can we?
Mako:Ugh, Bolin why did you drag me here. Sorry Korra and Asami.
Asami:Haha, it's ok guys. Just don't overstay your welcome...
Korra:Yeah...well let's get exploring!
Bolin:AHHHHHH WHAT IS THAT?!?!?!?!
Mako:Bolin! Stop, it's just Iroh. Looks like he's enjoying his tea like usual.
Iroh:Ah, welcome guys. It's great to have company here in the Spirit World. What brings you all here?
Korra:Just some vacation. Saving the world really took it out of me.
